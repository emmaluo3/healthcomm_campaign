# COMM4190 Health Communication Project

* For our project, we aimed to create digital health campaigns for STD prevention in college students using two contrasting health communication appeals: fear appeal and humor appeal. Since creating these campaigns was an experiment, we enlisted the help of artificial intelligence to help us test our ideas. By leveraging various AI tools, we were able to efficiently create compelling copy and images such as flyers and social media posts that we could then turn into an actual visual asset for the campaign.
